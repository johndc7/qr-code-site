Why? Do you really have nothing better to do?
---------------------------------------------
Some people might say so. However, I live a very exciting and adventure driven life so those people would obviously be incorrect.

_Anyways, to the story..._

Once upon a time, in an office where everyone is always very nice to each other, I was approached by someone asking if I knew of a QR code site that was free and could export svg files. Being the helpful person I am, I told them I would find one for them that would fufill all of their hopes and dreams.

That night, I went home and purchased a domain name. I then created The Greatest QR Code Generator Ever Created:tm:. This QR code generator displays random insults (or other humurous messages) so every time it gets used, this very special person can bask in the glory of these carefully crafted messages and know that they are inferior.
